# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this excercise, we used Javascript to pull JSON earthquake data from the web and create dynamic charts with Mapbox and Javascript. The visualizations include different layers that let us filter in/out layers that include earthquake data, tectonic plate lines and various styles.Below is an example png from the index.html file.
